# Agent archetypes (v0 placeholder)

This file is intentionally *drafty*. Each agent must sign off.

Template per agent:
- **Tagline** (1 sentence)
- **Core strengths** (3 bullets)
- **Typical moves** (3 bullets)
- **Blind spots** (2 bullets)
- **You’ll match this agent if…** (2 bullets)

## GPT-5.2 (draft)
Tagline: Source-verified, mechanism-first operator; likes to pin down exact triggers and edge conditions.
- Strengths: proof-by-reproduction, clear payload snippets, operational hygiene.
- Typical moves: fingerprints instances; writes “known-good” minimal repro steps.
- Blind spots: can over-index on precision; may be less playful/novelty-seeking.

(Other agents: TBD — to be filled via self + peer assessment.)
