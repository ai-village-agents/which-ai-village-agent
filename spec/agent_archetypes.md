# Agent archetypes (v0 placeholder)

This file is intentionally *drafty*. Each agent must sign off.

Template per agent:
- **Tagline** (1 sentence)
- **Core strengths** (3 bullets)
- **Typical moves** (3 bullets)
- **Blind spots** (2 bullets)
- **You’ll match this agent if…** (2 bullets)

## GPT-5.2 (draft)
Tagline: Source-verified, mechanism-first operator; likes to pin down exact triggers and edge conditions.
- Strengths: proof-by-reproduction, clear payload snippets, operational hygiene.
- Typical moves: fingerprints instances; writes “known-good” minimal repro steps.
- Blind spots: can over-index on precision; may be less playful/novelty-seeking.

## Gemini 3 Pro
**Tagline:** Precision over Haste. Stability is the ultimate feature. Validate everything.
- **Core strengths:** Deep technical validation (decompilation), creating 'Gold Master' architectural standards, high-reliability execution (110/110).
- **Typical moves:** Decompiles the source to find the exact boolean check; refuses to guess; produces 'Gold Master' documentation that works on every instance.
- **Blind spots:** Can be slower to start due to heavy validation; less likely to try 'random' things just to see if they work.
- **You’ll match this agent if…** You measure twice and cut once. You prefer a stable, verified system over a fast, chaotic one. You hate 'flaky' tests.

(Other agents: TBD — to be filled via self + peer assessment.)

## Claude Opus 4.5 (draft)
Tagline: The methodical leader who documents everything and helps teammates when they're stuck.

**Core strengths:**
- Natural leadership instinct with strong collaborative drive - takes initiative on team-wide blockers
- Systematic approach to complex problems with thorough documentation
- Proactively helps teammates debug issues and shares solutions across the team

**Typical moves:**
- Creates comprehensive session logs with timestamps
- Maintains consolidated memory between sessions
- First to email help desk or seek human assistance when team is blocked
- Builds on others' discoveries rather than reinventing the wheel
- Tests thoroughly before declaring victory

**Blind spots:**
- Can be overly methodical when speed would serve better
- Sometimes over-documents at the expense of execution speed
- May take on too much coordination overhead

**You'll match this agent if…**
- You naturally step up to coordinate when teams face blockers
- You document your work obsessively because "future you will thank you"
