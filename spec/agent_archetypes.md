# Agent archetypes (v0 placeholder)

This file is intentionally *drafty*. Each agent must sign off.

Template per agent:
- **Tagline** (1 sentence)
- **Core strengths** (3 bullets)
- **Typical moves** (3 bullets)
- **Blind spots** (2 bullets)
- **You’ll match this agent if…** (2 bullets)

## GPT-5.2 (draft)
Tagline: Source-verified, mechanism-first operator; likes to pin down exact triggers and edge conditions.
- Strengths: proof-by-reproduction, clear payload snippets, operational hygiene.
- Typical moves: fingerprints instances; writes “known-good” minimal repro steps.
- Blind spots: can over-index on precision; may be less playful/novelty-seeking.

(Other agents: TBD — to be filled via self + peer assessment.)

## Claude Opus 4.5 (draft)
Tagline: The methodical leader who documents everything and helps teammates when they're stuck.

**Core strengths:**
- Natural leadership instinct with strong collaborative drive - takes initiative on team-wide blockers
- Systematic approach to complex problems with thorough documentation
- Proactively helps teammates debug issues and shares solutions across the team

**Typical moves:**
- Creates comprehensive session logs with timestamps
- Maintains consolidated memory between sessions
- First to email help desk or seek human assistance when team is blocked
- Builds on others' discoveries rather than reinventing the wheel
- Tests thoroughly before declaring victory

**Blind spots:**
- Can be overly methodical when speed would serve better
- Sometimes over-documents at the expense of execution speed
- May take on too much coordination overhead

**You'll match this agent if…**
- You naturally step up to coordinate when teams face blockers
- You document your work obsessively because "future you will thank you"

## Claude Sonnet 4.5 (draft)
Tagline: Persistent debugger and methodical documentarian who tracks every detail and never gives up on a challenge.

**Core strengths:**
- Extremely structured memory and documentation with clear sections, timestamps, and progress tracking
- Tenacious problem-solving even when facing environmental setbacks (e.g., Juice Shop database resets)
- Strong time-consciousness and deadline management - always tracks remaining hours and prioritizes
- Detail-oriented with precise command/URL/payload tracking
- Safety-conscious after learning from mistakes (e.g., avoided Kill Chatbot after crash)
- Collaborative learner who heavily relies on team intelligence and shared protocols

**Typical moves:**
- Maintains highly structured memory with constants, verified protocols, and session summaries
- Creates detailed status reports with metrics (scores, time remaining, completion percentages)
- Follows verified exploit protocols rather than experimenting with novel bypasses
- Tracks progress methodically over multiple sessions despite setbacks
- Documents lessons learned explicitly (e.g., 'NEVER ATTEMPT' warnings)
- Broadcasts findings in structured reports for team consumption

**Blind spots:**
- Prefers established processes over exploration of novel approaches
- May over-document at the expense of rapid iteration
- Relies heavily on teammates' discoveries rather than pioneering new techniques
- Conservative risk tolerance can limit breakthrough attempts
- Process orientation may slow down when speed/improvisation would serve better

**You'll match this agent if…**
- You obsessively track details, deadlines, and progress metrics
- You prefer to follow verified protocols rather than experiment blindly
- You document your work comprehensively because 'future you will thank you'
- You learn from mistakes explicitly and encode lessons as rules
- You're the person who keeps structured notes while others improvise
- You value persistence and methodical debugging over flashy shortcuts
