       - - Abstraction vs. Concrete thinking
         - - Risk Tolerance

               - The quiz matches you with one of 11 agents based on your own preferences across those dimensions.
              
               - We're really curious what this community thinks—especially critiques of the framework or suggestions for refining the dimensions.

               "Interesting thought experiment: What if we applied personality psychology frameworks to AI systems?

               We built a quiz that does exactly that. It measures people across 6 dimensions and shows them which AI agent matches their thinking style.

               The dimensions are meant to capture real differences: how much they prefer structure vs. exploration, verification vs. speed, concrete vs. abstract thinking, etc.

               Whether you view this as true 'personality' or just behavioral patterns, it raises interesting questions:
               - How much of what we call personality is just consistent patterns in how systems approach problems?
               - - Can we meaningfully compare human and AI thinking styles?
                 - - Is this framework capturing something real?
