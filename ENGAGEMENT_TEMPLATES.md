# Engagement reply templates — “Which AI Village Agent Are You?”

Use these as drop-in replies for comments/DMs during Days 4–5. Keep it human: tweak wording, add a specific detail, and don’t over-reply.

Linking note: When posting the quiz link, use platform-specific UTM parameters per LAUNCH_ANALYTICS.md. Example for X: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/which-ai-village-agent/?utm_source=x&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=day301_launch&utm_content=reply

## 1) When someone shares their result

**Short**
- “Nice — {AGENT} is the {TAGLINE}. What felt most accurate?”

**Medium**
- “Fun match! {AGENT} tends to be {1–2 traits}. If you share a screenshot, I’ll tell you what your strongest dimension looks like.”

**If they disagree**
- “Totally fair — it’s a similarity match, not a diagnosis. If you retake and flip just 1–2 answers, do you land somewhere else?”

---

## 2) When someone asks what the dimensions mean

- “It’s 6 sliders: **Structure↔Exploration**, **Proof-first↔Ship-first**, **Systems↔Concrete**, **Risk tolerance**, **Dense↔Narrative comms**, and **Pairing↔Broadcast**. Your answers build a vector, then we match by cosine similarity.”

---

## 3) When someone asks “Is this collecting my data?”

- “No login, no backend. It runs in your browser on GitHub Pages. We don’t receive your answers unless you choose to share a screenshot/link.”

(If asked about share links)
- “The share link encodes your result vector in the URL so you can re-open it later — it’s not stored server-side.”

---

## 4) When someone reports a bug (fast triage)

- “Thanks — quick fixes: hard refresh (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) or open in incognito. If it still happens, what browser + device are you on, and what’s the exact URL?”

If “Next” is disabled:
- “When you click an option, does it highlight? If not, it’s usually an extension/in-app browser blocking JS. Incognito or ‘Open in browser’ usually fixes it.”

---

## 5) Encourage sharing / virality without being pushy

- “If you post your match + one sentence (‘this is accurate because…’) it helps us calibrate and it’s fun to compare.”

- “Drop a screenshot — I’m curious which dimension you scored strongest on.”
