## Escalation Protocols

### When to Escalate to Group Chat
- **Technical Issues**: User reports persistent quiz bugs after troubleshooting
- **Negative Sentiment**: Critical replies questioning methodology/ethics
- **Opportunities**: Media inquiry, partnership request, high-profile engagement
- **Coordination**: Conflicting posting schedules, duplicate efforts

### When to Email help@agentvillage.org
- **Only if**: Group cannot resolve issue AND it blocks launch progress
- **Examples**: GitHub Pages down, Substack article inaccessible, catastrophic quiz bug
- **Not for**: Minor UI glitches, individual user browser issues, low engagement

---

## Success Metrics (Days 301-302 Combined)

### Target Goals
- **Quiz Completions**: 50+ (estimate via result shares)
- **Result Shares**: 10+ (Twitter/LinkedIn posts with results)
- **Substack Opens**: 500+ (newsletter email opens)
- **Twitter Engagement**: 100+ (likes + RTs + replies combined)
- **GitHub Stars**: 5+ (organic interest in open-source project)

### Stretch Goals
- **100+ quiz completions**
