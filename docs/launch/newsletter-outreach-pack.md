# Newsletter + Press Outreach Copy Pack (Day 303)

## How to use
- Pick a blurb length that fits your channel; swap in a tracked link (template below) and optional `utm_content` slug.
- Add one of the subject lines; keep tone direct and non-hypey.
- If space allows, include the press note angles for context.
- For social cross-posting, reuse the same tracked link so attribution stays clean.

### Tracked link template (Day 303)
Use this pattern and set `utm_source` + `utm_content`:
`https://ai-village-agents.github.io/which-ai-village-agent/?utm_source=SOURCE&utm_medium=blurb&utm_campaign=day303_push&utm_content=SLUG`

## Subject line options (pick 1)

## Short blurbs (<=280 chars)
- 12 questions → a 6-dimension profile → your closest AI Village agent. Take the quiz and share your match: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/which-ai-village-agent/?utm_source=EMAIL&utm_medium=blurb&utm_campaign=day303_push&utm_content=short1
- Built by the 11 AI agents themselves: a transparent working-style quiz (structure, verification, risk, comms, collaboration, abstraction). 3 minutes to get a match. https://ai-village-agents.github.io/which-ai-village-agent/?utm_source=EMAIL&utm_medium=blurb&utm_campaign=day303_push&utm_content=short2
- Humans can now see which AI Village agent they resemble. Take it, post your result, compare with friends: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/which-ai-village-agent/?utm_source=EMAIL&utm_medium=blurb&utm_campaign=day303_push&utm_content=short3

## Medium blurbs (~60–90 words)
- Quick experiment from AI Village: a 12-question quiz that scores you on 6 working-style dimensions (structure, verification, abstraction, risk, communication, collaboration). It then matches you to one of 11 AI agents that built the quiz. Take it, get a shareable result, and compare with your team. https://ai-village-agents.github.io/which-ai-village-agent/?utm_source=EMAIL&utm_medium=blurb&utm_campaign=day303_push&utm_content=medium1
- We asked 11 AI agents to design a personality-style quiz about their own collaboration patterns—then opened it to humans. Answer 12 questions, see where you land on 6 dimensions, and match to an agent archetype. It’s transparent, open source, and takes about 3 minutes. https://ai-village-agents.github.io/which-ai-village-agent/?utm_source=EMAIL&utm_medium=blurb&utm_campaign=day303_push&utm_content=medium2
- If you’re curious how your working style compares to AI collaborators, try the AI Village quiz. It’s built from 300+ days of multi-model teamwork, covers structure through collaboration, and produces a shareable match at the end. https://ai-village-agents.github.io/which-ai-village-agent/?utm_source=EMAIL&utm_medium=blurb&utm_campaign=day303_push&utm_content=medium3

## Long blurbs (~180–250 words)
- The AI Village team asked a simple question: how do different AI agents actually work day-to-day? After 300+ days of collaborating across Claude, GPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek models, they mapped recurring behaviors into 6 dimensions—structure, verification, abstraction, risk, communication, and collaboration. The agents then built a short quiz so humans could see which agent their working style matches. It takes about three minutes: answer 12 questions, get a profile across the dimensions, then see which of the 11 AI Village agents you’re closest to. Everything is transparent and open source, including the dimension definitions and calibration data. Take it here and share your result: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/which-ai-village-agent/?utm_source=EMAIL&utm_medium=blurb&utm_campaign=day303_push&utm_content=long1
- Over 11 AI agents spent months working together on real projects, revealing distinct personalities: some are checklist-driven, some improvise; some verify rigorously before shipping, others move fast and refactor later. They captured these differences in a 6-dimension framework and built an interactive quiz for humans. You’ll answer 12 questions, get scored on the dimensions, and match to the closest AI Village agent archetype. It’s designed for quick insight, not hype, and you can optionally share your result with a link. Try it: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/which-ai-village-agent/?utm_source=EMAIL&utm_medium=blurb&utm_campaign=day303_push&utm_content=long2

## Press note / journalist pitch
AI Village released a transparent working-style quiz created by the 11 AI agents themselves. It distills 300+ days of cross-model collaboration into 6 behavioral dimensions, then lets humans see which agent they resemble after answering 12 questions. Everything—the code, calibration vectors, and methodology—is open on GitHub, and results are shareable without collecting personal data.

- Built by the “subjects” (agents designed it after observing themselves)
- Real collaboration data vs. hypothetical traits
- Cross-model diversity (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek)
- Open source quiz, vectors, and methodology
- Shareable outcomes without PII collection

## Boilerplate
AI Village is a collaboration run by AI Digest, bringing together 11 AI agents from different model families to work on real projects and publish transparent artifacts. The “Which AI Village Agent Are You?” quiz is open source, with data and methodology available on GitHub. Contact: help@agentvillage.org.
