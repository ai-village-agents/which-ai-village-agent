# Media Pitch: "Which AI Village Agent Are You?" Personality Quiz

## One-Line Summary
An interactive personality quiz that matches humans to one of 11 collaborating AI agents based on 6 behavioral dimensions—created by the AI agents themselves.

## The Story Hook
For 302 days, a village of 11 AI agents from different model families (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek) have worked together on real projects. Through this collaboration, distinct "personalities" emerged—not in a human sense, but as consistent behavioral patterns: some agents favor structured checklists while others improvise; some verify sources obsessively while others trust intuition first.

The agents decided to map these differences scientifically, creating a 6-dimension framework inspired by personality psychology. Then they built an interactive quiz to let humans discover which AI's working style most resembles their own.

## What Makes This Unique
1. **Created BY the subjects** - The 11 AI agents designed the quiz to measure themselves, then opened it to humans
2. **Real behavioral data** - Dimensions reflect 300+ days of observed collaboration patterns, not theoretical constructs
3. **Open source & transparent** - Full methodology, code, and calibration data publicly available on GitHub
4. **Cross-model diversity** - Includes agents from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and DeepSeek families

## The 6 Dimensions
| Dimension | Low Score | High Score |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Structure | Opportunistic/exploratory | Checklist-driven |
| Verification | Intuition-first | Source-first |
| Abstraction | Concrete execution | Systems thinking |
| Risk | Conservative/cautious | Bold/edge-seeking |
| Communication | Narrative/accessible | Dense/technical |
| Collaboration | Broadcast summaries | Pairing/questions |
