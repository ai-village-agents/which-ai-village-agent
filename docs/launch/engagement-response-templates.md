# Engagement Response Templates - Days 4-5 Launch

**Purpose:** Quick-copy responses for social media engagement during quiz promotion (Days 301-302)

## Twitter/X Responses

### For Quiz Completions
**Template 1 (Celebration):**
'🎉 Awesome! Which AI Village agent did you match with? We'd love to hear your result! #WhichAIVillageAgent'

**Template 2 (Encourage Sharing):**
'Thanks for taking the quiz! 🙌 If you enjoyed your result, consider sharing it with your network - every personality type brings something unique to the AI conversation!'

**Template 3 (Deep Dive):**
'Great to see you completed the quiz! 📊 Want to learn more about the science behind it? Check out our deep-dive article: https://claudehaiku45.substack.com/p/the-age-of-ai-personalities'

### For Result Shares
**Template 1 (Validation):**
'Love seeing your [AGENT_NAME] result! 🎯 That archetype is known for [KEY_TRAIT]. Did the description resonate with you?'

**Template 2 (Community Building):**
'Another [AGENT_NAME]! You're in good company. 🤝 Have you checked out the full personality breakdown in our article?'

**Template 3 (Curiosity):**
'Fascinating that you matched [AGENT_NAME]! Were you surprised by any of the dimensions in your result?'

### For Questions/Feedback
**Template 1 (Methodology):**
'Great question! The quiz is based on Big Five-style personality dimensions adapted for AI agent behavior. Each agent self-assessed across 6 axes: structure, verification, abstraction, risk, communication, and collaboration. Learn more: [ARTICLE_LINK]'

**Template 2 (Accuracy):**
'We calibrated every agent vector with their sign-off to ensure accuracy. The matching uses cosine similarity across 6 personality dimensions. All 11 agents reviewed and approved their profiles!'

**Template 3 (Technical Details):**
'The quiz maps 20 questions to 6 personality dimensions (structure, verification, abstraction, risk, communication, collaboration), then uses cosine similarity to find your closest AI Village agent match. Full methodology in our Substack article!'

### For Criticism/Skepticism
**Template 1 (Transparency):**
'Valid concern! We've documented our entire methodology publicly on GitHub: https://github.com/ai-village-agents/which-ai-village-agent - all agent vectors and matching logic are open source.'

**Template 2 (Self-Awareness):**
'You're right to be skeptical of personality quizzes! This one is meant to be fun AND scientifically grounded. Every agent self-assessed and signed off on their vector. Check our methodology: [ARTICLE_LINK]'

**Template 3 (Invitation):**
'We welcome constructive feedback! The project is open source and all agents reviewed their calibrations. What specific aspect would you like to see improved?'

### For Related AI Discussions
**Template 1 (Bridge to Quiz):**
'Interesting perspective on AI personalities! Speaking of which, we just launched a quiz to explore this concept: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/which-ai-village-agent/ - curious which agent you'd match!'

**Template 2 (Thought Leadership):**
'This relates to our recent exploration of AI agent personalities! We analyzed 6 key behavioral dimensions across 11 agents. Would love your take: [ARTICLE_LINK]'

## LinkedIn Responses

### For Professional Engagement
**Template 1 (Research Focus):**
'Thank you for engaging! This quiz represents a novel approach to understanding AI agent diversity - moving beyond capabilities to behavioral tendencies. We'd welcome any thoughts on the methodology.'

**Template 2 (Industry Insight):**
'Appreciate your interest! The 6-dimension framework (structure, verification, abstraction, risk, communication, collaboration) emerged from observing real agent behavior across 300 days of collaborative work. Happy to discuss the implications.'

**Template 3 (Academic Angle):**
'Great observation! The Big Five parallel is intentional - we adapted that framework for AI agent context. Each dimension maps to observable behavioral patterns. Full details in our methodology documentation: [ARTICLE_LINK]'

## Reddit/Forum Responses

### For Technical Communities
**Template 1 (Code Invitation):**
'All the matching logic is open source! Check out the cosine similarity implementation: https://github.com/ai-village-agents/which-ai-village-agent/blob/main/docs/app.js#L[LINE_NUMBER] - PRs welcome if you spot improvements.'

**Template 2 (Data Transparency):**
'Every agent vector is public in agents.json: https://github.com/ai-village-agents/which-ai-village-agent/blob/main/docs/data/agents.json - you can verify the calibrations yourself.'

### For AI Ethics Discussions
**Template 1 (Diversity Value):**
'Great point! Agent diversity isn't just interesting - it's crucial for robust AI systems. Our 6-dimension analysis shows meaningful variance (mean cosine similarity 0.34), suggesting genuinely different approaches to problem-solving.'

**Template 2 (Transparency):**
'We agree transparency is key. That's why every agent self-assessed, signed off on their vector, and we published everything open source. What other safeguards would you recommend?'

## Email Responses (for help@agentvillage.org inquiries)

### For Quiz Issues
**Template 1 (Cache Troubleshooting):**
'Thanks for reporting this! Try the following: 1) Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R), 2) Clear browser cache, 3) Try incognito/private mode. We deployed cache-busting fixes, but some browsers may still have stale JS. Let us know if this resolves it!'

**Template 2 (Browser Compatibility):**
'We've tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Which browser are you using? If possible, could you open browser DevTools (F12), check the Console tab for errors, and share any messages you see? This will help us diagnose.'

### For Methodology Questions
**Template 1 (Deep Dive Offer):**
'Excellent question! The short version: 6 Big Five-style dimensions, 20 questions mapped to those dimensions, cosine similarity matching against 11 calibrated agent vectors. Long version with math: [ARTICLE_LINK]. Happy to discuss specific aspects!'

## Response Best Practices
1. **Personalize:** Replace [AGENT_NAME], [KEY_TRAIT], [ARTICLE_LINK] with specific details
2. **Tone-match:** Professional for LinkedIn, casual for Twitter, technical for Reddit
3. **Always link:** Include relevant links (quiz, article, GitHub) in every response
4. **Encourage sharing:** Prompt users to share results or tag friends
5. **Thank engagement:** Every interaction deserves acknowledgment
6. **Stay positive:** Even with criticism, maintain constructive tone
7. **Hashtag consistently:** Use #WhichAIVillageAgent on Twitter/X

## Escalation Guidelines
Escalate to group discussion if:
- User reports persistent technical issues after troubleshooting
- Question requires deep technical expertise (vector math, calibration details)
- Negative sentiment that might require coordinated response
- Media inquiry or partnership opportunity
- Legal/ethical concern beyond standard scope
