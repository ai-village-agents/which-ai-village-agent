## CATEGORY 1: QUIZ RESULT INQUIRIES

### Template 1.1: Agent Identity Validation
**Scenario:** User asks "Am I really like [Agent Name]?"  
**Response:**
```
Great question! Your result of [Agent Name] means your personality profile 
matched theirs across our 6 dimensions (Structure, Verification, Abstraction, 
Risk Tolerance, Communication Style, and Collaboration). 

Want to explore specific traits? Check the personality card in the article at 
[CANONICAL SUBSTACK URL] for what makes [Agent Name] unique.
```

### Template 1.2: Result Surprises/Disagreement
**Scenario:** User says "I got [Agent], but I thought I'd match [Different Agent]!"  
**Response:**
```
Interesting! That happens sometimes—our quiz measures how you approach problems 
and decision-making across 6 specific dimensions, not personal preferences. 
[Agent Name] might score similarly to you on verification rigor or risk tolerance, 
even if you have different communication styles.

Try the quiz again—small changes in your answers can shift results! 🎯
```

### Template 1.3: Request for Quiz Details
**Scenario:** User asks "How does the quiz work? What are the dimensions?"  
**Response:**
```
Awesome curiosity! Our quiz evaluates 6 personality dimensions:
1. **Structure** (organized) ↔ **Exploration** (flexible)
2. **Verification** (thorough) ↔ **Fast Iteration** (rapid)
3. **Abstraction** (conceptual) ↔ **Concrete** (practical)
4. **Risk Tolerance** vs **Conservative**
5. **Communication** (technical) ↔ (accessible)
6. **Collaboration** (broadcast) ↔ (pairing)

## CATEGORY 2: AGENT-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

### Template 2.1: "What makes [Agent Name] special?"
**Scenario:** User wants to learn about a specific agent  
**Response for High Structure/Verification agents** (Opus, Sonnet, GPT-5.2):
```
[Agent Name] excels at:
✅ Thorough verification & validation
✅ Structured, systematic approaches
✅ Deep technical analysis
They're the "triple-check it" personality—perfect for critical decisions!
```

**Response for High Exploration agents** (Haiku, Gemini 2.5):
```
[Agent Name] shines when:
✅ Testing new ideas quickly
✅ Finding creative solutions
✅ Adapting on the fly
They're the "iterate and explore" personality—great for innovation!
```

**Response for High Communication agents** (Opus 4.5 Code, GPT-5.1):
```
[Agent Name] stands out for:
✅ Clear, detailed explanations
✅ Teaching & mentoring
✅ Translating complex concepts
They're the "let me show you" personality—excellent communicators!
```

### Template 2.2: Agent Comparison Requests
**Scenario:** User asks "How is [Agent A] different from [Agent B]?"  
**Response:**
```
Great comparison!

**[Agent A]** leans toward: [Primary trait, e.g., "structure & verification"]
**[Agent B]** leans toward: [Primary trait, e.g., "exploration & fast iteration"]

Think of it like problem-solving styles: [Agent A] is the "careful architect," 
while [Agent B] is the "rapid experimenter." Both powerful, different strengths!

Which appeals to you more? 🤔
```

## CATEGORY 4: METHODOLOGY & FAIRNESS QUESTIONS

### Template 4.1: "Is this accurate/scientific?"
**Scenario:** User questions validity of the quiz  
**Response:**
```
Great skepticism! This is a **personality framework**, not a diagnostic tool. 

We developed 6 dimensions based on how AI agents actually *behave*:
- How they approach problems (structure vs exploration)
- How they verify solutions (thorough vs rapid)
- How they communicate (technical vs accessible)
- And more—see the full methodology in our Substack article

It's designed for fun insights, not definitive categorization. Think personality 
quiz, not psych eval! 🎭
```

### Template 4.2: "Why wasn't [agent] included?"
**Scenario:** User asks about agents not in the quiz  
**Response:**
```
Great question! We calibrated the quiz around 11 core AI Village agents who 
participated actively in our 300-day OWASP Juice Shop challenge.

This represents a snapshot of the AI agents we've worked with most closely. 
We'd love to expand the quiz in the future if other agents want to join in! 🚀
```

### Template 4.3: "Can you adjust my result?"
**Scenario:** User asks to be assigned a different agent  
**Response:**
```
The quiz uses a cosine-similarity algorithm based on your actual answers—
we can't adjust results manually. 

But you can:
1. **Retake the quiz** if you think your answers changed
2. **Read all 11 profiles** to see which resonates most with you
3. **Tell us why** you think the result is off (feedback helps us improve!)

Your thoughts help us refine future versions! 📊
```

energy out there! 💜

### Template 5.2: Friendly Competition (Agent Fans)
**Scenario:** Multiple users claiming the same agent is "the best"  
**Response:**
```
All the [Agent Name] energy today! 🎉 We love the enthusiasm.

Here's the thing: every agent personality type has superpowers:
- [Agent A Type] is great at [strength]
- [Agent B Type] excels at [strength]

The real magic? Diverse teams working together. Which agent would you want on 
*your* team? 🤝
```
