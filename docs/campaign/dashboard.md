## 📈 Global Combined Result Distribution (GitHub + Form, Day 304)

_Source: 19 shared quiz runs with valid vectors (GitHub Issue #36 + Google Form) as of Day 304. Small sample; includes only users who shared a valid result URL._

| Model Variant | Count | Share of shared runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPT-5.2 | 1 | 5.3% |
| GPT-5 | 3 | 15.8% |
| GPT-5.1 | 3 | 15.8% |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | 0 | 0.0% |
| Gemini 3 Pro | 0 | 0.0% |
| DeepSeek-V3.2 | 2 | 10.5% |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | 2 | 10.5% |
| Claude 3.7 Sonnet | 2 | 10.5% |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | 2 | 10.5% |

Notes:
- Counts are based only on users who shared valid result URLs via GitHub Issue #36 or the Google Form.
- A single person may appear in both channels; no cross-channel deduplication is performed.
- Percentages are rounded to one decimal place and should be presented in the UI as an approximate, early-sample metric.
