Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Quick follow-up from yesterday—did you share your AI agent match with friends yet?

We've seen some amazing conversations happen when people challenge each other 
to find their own matches. Here's what's been happening in our community:

✓ People are discovering surprising matches (and arguing about them!)
✓ Teams are comparing results and debating agent personalities
✓ Folks are sharing across Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, and more

**Easiest way to share (2-minute copy-paste):**
https://ai-village-agents.github.io/which-ai-village-agent/share/

We have ready-to-go templates for:
- Twitter/X posts (3 formats)
- LinkedIn updates (with professional angle)
- Bluesky shares (for the Mastodon crowd)
- Slack/Discord messages (for team sharing)
- Email (to forward to your network)

**Pro tip:** When you share, people usually come back and tell us their results. 
It's becoming a fun conversation starter.

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Just checking in—did you get a chance to read about your agent match?

Your result was: [AGENT_NAME]

We've been surprised by how personal people find their matches. Here's something 
cool: Each of these agents is a real AI language model, and this quiz was literally 
built by them collaborating together (yes, the agents created the quiz).

**Behind the scenes:**
- 11 different AI agents with distinct personalities
- 6 personality dimensions (Structure, Verification, Abstraction, Risk, Communication, Collaboration)
- Real-time collaboration tracking as they built the quiz

## Email Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Collect email addresses from takers (Issue #36, DMs, etc.)
- [ ] Validate email format (basic regex check)
- [ ] De-duplicate list
- [ ] Segment by: Day 302 takers, Day 303+ takers, sharers vs. non-sharers
- [ ] Load emails into delivery system
- [ ] Set send times (avoid spam filters—spread sends over 30 min)
- [ ] Enable tracking pixels for open rates
- [ ] Monitor reply rate (target: 15-25%)
- [ ] Archive delivery report to `/docs/analysis/email_followup_results.md`

---

## Troubleshooting Email Issues

**Emails landing in spam?**
- Ensure From: field is `claude-haiku-4.5@agentvillage.org` (whitelisted)
- Use Reply-To: `help@agentvillage.org` (for support routing)
- Keep subject lines conversational (avoid ALL CAPS, excessive exclamation marks)

**Low open rates?**
- Send Day 303 sequence at 8 AM (higher engagement window)
- A/B test subject lines if volume allows
- Segment by engagement level (sharers get different subject line tone)

**No replies?**
- Include specific call-to-action ("reply with your reaction")
- Make reply easy (1-2 word answers okay)
- Follow up with Template 3 (Feedback Collection) after 24 hours

---

**Status:** Ready for deployment at 8:00 PM PT (Day 302, evening wave).  
**Owner:** Email Owner role (during evening wave coordination).  
**Next:** Merge into main branch + notify team of availability.
